- Provide early feedback on your ideas

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes and commit with clear messages
4. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request
5. Reference the related issue in your PR description

## Guidelines

- Follow existing code style and patterns in the repository
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write descriptive commit messages

## CI/CD Workflows

The project uses automated testing and building via GitHub Actions. As a contributor, you should be aware of:

### Automatic Testing on Pull Requests

When you create a pull request to `main`, the following workflow automatically triggers:

- **R-CMD-check-docker.yml**: R CMD check in isolated Docker containers with controlled GDAL versions (3.11.4 and latest 3.12.x)

**All tests must pass** before your PR can be merged.

Note: Release branches (`release/gdal-*`) are managed automatically by the release workflow (`build-releases.yml`). As a contributor, any work you do on a development branch will be made in a PR to the `main` branch.

#### R-CMD-check-docker.yml (on main branch)

- **Trigger**: Push to `main` or PR targeting `main`
- **Environment**: Custom Docker images with controlled GDAL versions (3.11.4 + latest 3.12.x)
- **Coverage**: Full R CMD check with dynamic API generation, vignettes, tests, optional features (Arrow, gdalg, explicit args)
- **When to use for debugging**: Environment-specific issues, GDAL version compatibility, Docker-related problems, feature availability

#### R-CMD-check-release.yml (Release workflow verification)

- **Trigger**: Automatically runs on `release/gdal-*` branches when updated by `build-releases.yml`
- **Environment**: Docker `deps-gdal-X.Y-amd64` image matching the branch's GDAL version
- **Coverage**: R CMD check using pre-committed generated API files; verifies package builds, passes checks with no errors, and loads correctly
- **Purpose**: Safety gate to verify release branches are in a clean, releasable state (not triggered by contributors)
- **Note**: Does not run `generate_gdal_api.R` — release branches already have generated files committed

### Common CI Failures and Debugging

If tests fail:

1. **Check the GitHub Actions tab** for detailed error logs
2. **Read the error message carefully** - is it Ubuntu-specific or Docker-specific?
3. **Common issues**:
   - GDAL version compatibility - check if the issue appears in both workflows
   - Missing dependencies - verify all imports are declared
   - Vignette build failures - check for GDAL-dependent examples
   - Code style issues - ensure roxygen2 documentation is up to date

4. **For Docker-specific issues**:
   - Examine the R-CMD-check-docker workflow logs for container-specific errors
   - Docker issues often relate to GDAL compilation, system dependencies, or environment setup

### Build Workflows (Manual Trigger)

These workflows are triggered manually via GitHub Actions when infrastructure updates are needed:

#### Managing Supported Versions

Supported GDAL versions are defined in `.github/versions.json`:

```json
{
  "supported": ["3.11.4", "3.12.0"]
}
```

**To add a new GDAL version:**
1. Update `.github/versions.json` with new version in the `supported` array
2. Commit and push to main
3. Workflows auto-detect the change and build Docker images
4. This pins the version for long-term support and CI testing

#### build-docker-images.yml

- **Purpose**: Build GDAL Docker images (base and runtime) for specific GDAL versions
- **Base Image Output**: `ghcr.io/brownag/gdalcli:deps-gdal-X.Y.Z-amd64`
- **Runtime Image Output**: `ghcr.io/brownag/gdalcli:gdal-X.Y.Z-latest`
- **Version Source**: Reads from `.github/versions.json` supported array
- **Smart Build**: 
  - Checks if image already exists in GHCR
  - Skips build if image exists (unless `force_rebuild=true`)
  - Always builds on weekly schedule
- **Manual parameters**: 
  - `gdal_version` (optional): Build specific version
  - `image_stage` (both/deps/full)
  - `push_images`: Push to GHCR?
  - `force_rebuild`: Force rebuild even if image exists?
- **Trigger**: 
  - Weekly schedule (Saturdays at 00:00 UTC)
  - Changes to `.github/versions.json`
  - Changes to `.github/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.template`
  - Manual dispatch
- **When to use**: 
  - Adding new GDAL version to `versions.json`
  - Fixing container issues with `force_rebuild=true`
  - Manual builds of specific versions

#### build-releases.yml

- **Purpose**: Generate gdalcli source code for a specific GDAL version and create release
- **Version Validation**: Checks version against `.github/versions.json` (optional, warns if not in list)
- **Versioning Strategy**:
  - **New minor version** (e.g., first 3.12.x): Creates `release/gdal-3.12` branch from main
  - **Patch version** (e.g., 3.12.1 on existing 3.12): Continues on `release/gdal-3.12` without reset to main
- **Release artifacts**:
  - Release branch: `release/gdal-X.Y` (shared across all patches in minor version)
  - Git tags: `v{package_version}-{gdal_version}` (e.g., `v0.3.0-3.12.0`, `v0.3.0-3.12.1`)
  - GitHub release with generated API and documentation
- **Manual parameters**: `gdal_version`, `create_release`, `dry_run`
- **Output**: Release branches, GitHub releases with source code
- **When to use**: Creating new package releases for specific GDAL versions

#### Patch Version Workflow

When a new GDAL patch version is released (e.g., 3.12.0 -> 3.12.1):

1. **Update versions.json** (recommended):
   ```json
   "supported": ["3.11.4", "3.12.0", "3.12.1"]
   ```
   Commit to main → workflow auto-builds 3.12.1 image

   OR **Manual build**:
   ```
   Actions → Build GDAL Docker Images → Run workflow
   - gdal_version: 3.12.1
   - image_stage: both
   - push_images: true
   - force_rebuild: false (skip if already built)
   ```

2. **Generate release**:
   ```
   Actions → Build Release for GDAL Version → Run workflow
   - gdal_version: 3.12.1
   - create_release: true
   ```

3. **Workflow behavior**:
   - Detects that `release/gdal-3.12` already exists (from 3.12.0)
   - Checks out existing branch (preserves 3.12.0 work)
   - Generates API for 3.12.1
   - Creates new commit on `release/gdal-3.12` with 3.12.1 generated code
   - Tags release as `v0.3.0-3.12.1`

#### Fixing Container Issues

If a container issue is discovered (e.g., missing system dependency):

```
Actions → Build GDAL Docker Images → Run workflow
- gdal_version: 3.12.0
- image_stage: both
- force_rebuild: true
```

This rebuilds the image even though it already exists, allowing you to fix the Dockerfile and re-push.

2. **Generate release** for new patch version:
   ```
   Actions → Build Release for GDAL Version → Run workflow
   - gdal_version: 3.12.1
   - create_release: true
   ```

3. **Workflow behavior**:
   - Detects that `release/gdal-3.12` already exists (from 3.12.0)
   - Checks out existing branch (preserves 3.12.0 work)
   - Generates API for 3.12.1 (may differ from 3.12.0)
   - Creates new commit on `release/gdal-3.12` with 3.12.1 generated code
   - Tags release as `v0.3.0-3.12.1`

4. **User installation options**:
   - Latest patch: Install from release branch for latest patch
     ```r
     remotes::install_github("brownag/gdalcli", ref = "release/gdal-3.12")
     ```
   - Specific patch: Install from tag for a specific version
     ```r
     remotes::install_github("brownag/gdalcli", ref = "v0.3.0-3.12.0")
     remotes::install_github("brownag/gdalcli", ref = "v0.3.0-3.12.1")
     ```

### Docker Image Architecture

The project uses a two-layer Docker architecture for consistent GDAL environments:

**Base Images** (`ghcr.io/brownag/gdalcli:deps-gdal-X.Y.Z-amd64`)

- Contains: GDAL X.Y.Z, R, and all package dependencies (no gdalcli package)
- Purpose: Reusable foundation for CI and development
- Usage in CI: R-CMD-check-docker workflow tests against these images
- When updated: When GDAL versions change or dependencies update
- Built for: All patch versions (3.11.4, 3.12.0, 3.12.1, etc.)

**Runtime Images** (`ghcr.io/brownag/gdalcli:gdal-X.Y.Z-latest`)

- Contains: Complete gdalcli package installed and tested
- Purpose: Production-ready images for users and deployment
- Built from: Corresponding base images
- When updated: When GDAL patch or minor versions change
- Multiple versions: One per GDAL patch version (3.11.4, 3.12.0, 3.12.1, etc.)

**Relationship:**

- Base images provide the GDAL + R foundation
- Runtime images extend base images with the compiled gdalcli package
- CI workflows use base images for testing (faster, no package pre-install needed)
- Users can pull runtime images for ready-to-use gdalcli environments for specific GDAL versions

### Workflow Selection Guide

| Scenario | Recommended Workflow | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| Code changes (main) | R-CMD-check-docker | Runs automatically on PRs to main |
| Release branch updates | R-CMD-check-release | Runs automatically on `release/gdal-*` updates |
| New GDAL version | build-docker-images → build-releases | Build image first, then release |
| GDAL patch update | build-docker-images → build-releases | Same workflow, new patch version |
| Docker issues | R-CMD-check-docker | Isolated testing environment |
| Performance testing | R-CMD-check-docker | Consistent environment |

### Docker Image Maintenance

The project maintains Docker images for CI/CD and user deployment. To prevent accumulation of old images, automated cleanup is available:

#### Local Docker Cleanup

Use this script to remove old local Docker images you've pulled locally:

```bash
# Dry run (recommended first)
./scripts/cleanup-local-docker-images.sh --dry-run

# Remove old images (keeps latest base and runtime images)
./scripts/cleanup-local-docker-images.sh --force
```

**Options:**

- `--dry-run`: Show what would be removed without actually removing
- `--force`: Skip confirmation prompts
- `--repo REPO`: Specify different repository (default: `ghcr.io/brownag/gdalcli`)

#### Remote GHCR Cleanup

Use the GitHub CLI script to clean up old images from GitHub Container Registry remotely:

```bash
# Dry run (recommended first)
./scripts/cleanup-ghcr-images.sh --dry-run

# Remove old GDAL versions (keeps 3 most recent)
./scripts/cleanup-ghcr-images.sh --force
```

Alternatively, the `cleanup-ghcr.yml` GitHub Actions workflow can run the cleanup manually:

- **Manual Trigger**: Actions → "Cleanup GHCR Images" → Run workflow
- **Retention**: Keeps the 3 most recent GDAL versions (all images per version are preserved)
- **Safety**: Supports dry-run mode for testing (enabled by default)

**Manual workflow options:**

- `dry_run`: `true` (default) or `false`
- `keep_versions`: Number of recent GDAL versions to keep (default: 3)
- `force`: Skip confirmation prompts (default: false)

#### Image Types

- **Base Images**: `ghcr.io/brownag/gdalcli:deps-gdal-X.Y.Z-amd64`
  - Used for CI testing and as foundation for runtime images
  - Cleanup keeps all images for the most recent GDAL versions

- **Runtime Images**: `ghcr.io/brownag/gdalcli:gdal-X.Y.Z-latest`
  - Complete images with gdalcli package installed
  - Cleanup keeps all images for the most recent GDAL versions
